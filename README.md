# Hi there 👋

<!--
**lishaduck/lishaduck** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: my [bikes-by-eli](https://github.com/lishaduck/Bikes-By-Eli) repository (which is for time being private). It's for my not-for-profit.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about: the [elm](https://elm-lang.org) language.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing really.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: again, nothing really.
- 💬 How to ask me about something: I'm probably not the best person to ask 😁
- 📫 How to reach me: Don't?
- ⚡ Fun fact: Programming is cool. It's a fact now.  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
